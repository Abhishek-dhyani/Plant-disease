# Plant-disease
This script uses the process of fine tuning to classify leaf photographs into plant diseases. In practice, deep neural networks like Covnet has a huge number of parameters, often in the range of millions. Training a Covnet on a small dataset (one that is smaller than the number of parameters) greatly affects the Covnetâ€™s ability to generalize, often result in overfitting.  Therefore, more often in practice, one would fine-tune existing networks that are trained on a large dataset like the ImageNet (1.2M labeled images) by continue training it (i.e. running back-propagation) on the smaller dataset we have. Provided that our dataset is not drastically different in context to the original dataset (e.g. ImageNet), the pre-trained model will already have learned features that are relevant to our own classification problem. The model was trained on google colab.
